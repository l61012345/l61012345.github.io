# Part B：观点描述题
## 审题
### 题目类型
1. 立场型(Argument)  
A. 是否同意?选哪边？（尽量不中立）   
Do you agree or disagree?/Which would be better?  
B.  有多大程度同意（可选中立）    
⋆To what extent  do you agree or disagree?  
   - I totally agree/disagree with…
   - It can be desicribed as a double-edge sword. 
可以选一边作答。  

2. 分析利弊型(Evalulation)  
Do the **advantages** of this **outweigh** the disadvantages?  
优缺点两方面构思，两边都要提到。   
利大于弊：先说好处，最后让步说弊（一定要提弊端），最好不要说两面同等占比  
   - I think the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantage

{% note warning %}  
只是如果只是单纯询问优缺点是什么，则只需要主观列举，不要加入自己的看法。  
What are the advantages and disadvantages?   
{% endnote %}


3. 双边讨论型(Discussion)  
⋆**Disscus** both views and give your own view.  
要讨论两边（比如要独立讨论），再给出自己的立场，或者两边都支持/不支持   

4. 综合分析型(Report，低频)  
What are the **reasons** and give your measures to reduce it?  
To discuss the Causes / Problems / **Solutions**.  
从原因分析，结合实际的生活作答，纯客观说明，怎么提问怎么回答  
其他类型的题目，根据题意作答  

### 话题
常见的话题包括：  
教育、科技、环境、政府决策、社会发展、犯罪、文化、媒体  

### 话题关键词
话题关键词展示了题干中的观点、争议点和观点的描述对象。  
应当注意：观点的主谓（观点对象）、修饰成分（确定描述对象）、逻辑关系（比较对象）。  
**如果题干中的观点含有并列结构，应当分段分别论证。**  
例如： Some people think <u>this has negative effects</u> and <u>should be banned</u>.  

#### 观点主谓  
观点中的主语陈述了对象。  
观点中的谓语动词是观点的重点，应该特别注意区分。  
例如： “Students <u>should spend a period of time</u> to study in different country to learn the different cultures.”中重点应当是出国而不是学习其他文化。“Government <u>should make people responsible</u> for environmental protection”中观点的重点是在政府强制。    

#### 修饰成分  
观点中的修饰成分通常表示目的，限定了讨论的方向，但并非是讨论的重点。  
例如：“<u>In modern society</u>, it is of more disadvantage to become elderly.”中所有的优点和缺点应当围绕现代社会发展展开。  

#### 逻辑关系  
- 极端词  
观点中的逻辑关系包括形容词最高级(best/most)/极端的形容词和副词(all/only)/含有极端意义的动词(ban/stop/forbid)。  
例如：“the best way to solve this problem is to limit the cars on road.”  
通常题目观点出现极端词时，比较容易反驳题目中的观点。此时可以采取让步反驳的方式，先认同对方的合理性，再进行反驳，体现出辩证。  
- 取代关系  
在出现取代关系时（比如"the museums should be cancled because people can explore exhibitors on the Internet."），证明取代的重点应当放在证明二者的同一性和重合部分，证明不能被取代的重点放在独一性。  
- 因果关系  
观点中因果关系的作用是限定描述的内容，在写作时应当紧扣原因论述。  

### 审题步骤
- 先看题干最下方的题目类型，写作任务  
- 根据一些描述观点性的词语（claim/say/consider）找到题干中的观点  
- 回到题干前找话题
- 看题干给出的背景

## 构思
### 确定立场
先构思一些正反理由，根据理由的数量选择立场。   

### 构建分论点
如果题干中有概括性的词语，应当首先对其细化。  

#### 维度法
分论点思路可以从三个维度考虑：  
- 长视短视：从长远的角度思考  
- 外在内在：表面上和实际上  
- 个体整体：对个人和对整个集体  

#### 主题法
从一些固定的视角去考虑优势和劣势，进行构思。这些话题包括：  
- 钱/经济/就业  
  例如:"In the future, robots will replace most of the manual labour?"
  - pros: 
     - lower cost
  - cons: 
     - a large expanditure of mantenace and manufacture
     - unemployment
- 时间和效率
   - pros: 
      - enhance the efficiency and more productivity
      - higher precision and accurancy
   - cons:  
      - might break the control.
- 空间/安全  
  例如："some people prefer 'horizontal city', where there are few tall buildings, while others enjoy 'vertical city' with many tall buildings"  
  - pros(vertical city):  
    - provide higher land utility
    - higher population density
  - cons(vertical city):  
    - safty issue
- 心理状态/身体健康  
  \* 在围绕心理状态来陈述的分论点时，尽量详细的描述感受，使得分论点丰满。  
  \* 身体健康难以写具体，通常不作为单独的分论点。  

- 教育  
  相关语料：  
   - textbook of history teaching  
   - lay a foundation for future career  

- 文化  
  相关语料：  
  - extinction of cultrual identity
  - cultrual conflict
  - ideology 意识形态

- 环境  
  相关语料：  
  - waste emission 尾气排放
  - contamination n.污染
  - green house effects 温室效应
  - acid rain 酸雨
  - haze n. 雾霾
  - ozone layer hole 臭氧层空洞

- 权益  
  \*权益一般比较难写，通常写生存权和隐私权即可。  
  相关语料：  
  - deprive the living rights
  - invade/violet the private privacy

### 确定结构
根据立场来确定结构，如果观点不是绝对的(比如：Mostly/Partially)，可以首先写让步段，部分认同，再反驳让步的观点。  

### 构思范例
例： Some people think the media should stop reporting on details of crime. To what extent do you agree or disagress？  
1. 对题干中的概述词进行细化  
- details
  - identification of victim/motivation/criminal
  - location/time/modus operandi(M.O)
  - scenes
2. 对细化后每一个项目进行讨论。  
- scenes  
     - The report of cruel scenes may traumatise audiences even causing massive social panic.（心理健康）  
- identification of victim and criminal  
     - Covering the identification of victims and crimininals may violet the privacy leading to the further damage to the victims family and in most cases are misleading.  
- location/time/modus operandi(M.O)
     - The report of modus operandi in detail should be bannd to prevent from the copy-cats who may imitate the crimes threteaning to the public security. Meanwhile, it is harmful for teens without the ability of distingushing right from wrong to read the report of modus operandi.  
     - There is a importantce of reporting the locations and time of crimes to force the government to invest more on security configurations and reinforce the public awareness of crimes so as to protect themselves.

例：Should children begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school?  
- 分析    
   Should:  
  1. it's widely admitted that school-beginning is the golden age for language learning because the language-learning part in brain is the most active during this time.
  2. Young children are not occupied with too much things during this period.
  3. The culture can also be brought while leanring ,which helps them to explore the word.
  4. They will have a good start for the future study.
	
- 例文  
	As the improvement of the globalization, coorperation and communication across the sea are more important than any stage of the history. For every qualified citizen, not only is mastering a foreign language to meet requirements but also viewed as an essential competence. Nowadays, people increasingly attach great importance to the education on foreign language , a growing number of primary schools are now teaching foreign languages in the first semester. From where I stand, it's a beneficial practice without doubt.
	
	With the higher degree of globalization, transnational cooperation and communication have become 
	more crucial than ever. For each qualified modern citizen, mastering a foreign language is morc than a 
	necessity, but rather a requisite ability Nowadays, intensified emphasis has been laid upon foreign 
	language education. An increasing number of primary schools begin to teach a foreign language.  
  In the very first semester. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly a beneficial practice. 

## 开头段
### 开头段结构
背景句（事实引入）+改写题干（不是直接抄写题干）+个人立场  

### 导入部分（背景句）
在写作时背景导入如果没有想出来可以忽略。  
导入部分要有逻辑衔接。  
在事实引入部分和“引发了热烈的讨论”两句之间的逻辑要紧密。
逻辑必须要完整。  
- 功能(模板)句法      
常用模板句：
Nowadays, … is  playing an role in … when…  
Thanks to….,… is becoming increasingly  important.  
Recent years have witnessed that…  
The way we consider… is heavily influenced by….  
With the development of…, is becoming increasingly…  
	
   e.g.：Today, we live is heavily influenced by the modern technology.Recent years have witnessed the development of modern technology.

- 论据提前法  
在正文中不需要详细拓展的论据，作为开头的引入。  
e.g.: With the increasing air pollution, the use of transportation tools, such as airplanes, is definitely responsible for it. （环境污染为文章其中的一个论点）Therefore, some people think the use of aircrafts is not practical and causes many problems thus should be reduced. In my opinion, it's necessary to do so.  
	
   We can often people living nearby the airport always complain about the noise made by the airplane. Therefore...  
	
   It's widely agreed that not only the flight ticket but also the trip to back and from the airport are expensive. Therefore..  
	
- 场景表述法  
用相关的具体场景引出主题。  
e.g.：
	Have you ever been late for the date with friends because of the poor traffic? Have you ever felt irritable on the way to work during the rush hour on Monday morning?(用事实说明) Actually these situations are happening everyday,driving every city dweller crazy.
  	
	When the new lives coming into the world, what makes the unexperienced parents headache most is how to take care of babies. To settle the problem, the parenting course gains increasingly popularity nowadays. However, it also bring up to many issues. For instance, the classes actually are not adapt to all the babies. So some people think the parenting course should be reduced. And I'm deeply agree that.  


### 题干改写
改写方法：   
替换同义词 改写语态 名词性从句互换（主谓宾<->主系表）  
注意不要逐字逐句的改写，一种简单的改写方法是将其翻译为中文后改写为英语。  
语料：  
- The relative improtance of... and .../whether...or... is a frequenct discussed topic of discussion when...
- The focus of this essay is to illustrate the causes and explore some relevant and feasible measures to combat this situation.

e.g.：  
例题：Some people claim that the use of  tobacco has caused severe social problems thus should be banned.To what extent do you agree or disagree?  
改写: A point held by many people is that serious social problems have been triggered by smoking and it should be forbidden.  

#### 表达观点
引入观点的句子：  
- In my opinion
- as far as I am concerned
- from my point of view
- from my own perspective 

| 同意 | 反对 | 优点 | 缺点 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| advocate <br> support <br> embrace <br> endorse <br> be of the same mind with <br> do not reserve any approval of <br> see more reasonsi n the latter| oppose <br> be fail to agree with <br> in dispute with <br> mey perspective contradicts <br> the opinion can not deat much analysis <br> frown on/upon <br> cannot hold water <br> be acceptable but not recommendable <br> cause a few raised eyebrows | advantages <br> benefits <br> upsides <br> strengths <br> merits | disadvantages <br> drawbacks <br> downsides <br> weakness <br> demerits |




## 中间段展开
中间段主要是提出分论点并论证各分论点。论证需要消除理由和论点的逻辑断层，解释为什么可以支持论点，表明理由是合理的。观点和理由是因果关系，观点和理由之间需要用论据做逻辑衔接。  
中间段的作用是把理由分层叙述，让读者充分理解论点是合理的过程。  

### 首句
每一段的首句应当提出分论点，其后的句子进行进一步的论述和证明。  

### 论证方法
#### 道理论证
进一步解释中心句。  
- 语料：  
  - To be more precise
  - In other words  
  - That is...  

- 进一步解释可以从:what/who/when/where/how/why这几个方面思考。  
例如：  
题干：Governments have spent too much money on scientific research. To what extent do you agree or disagree?  
分论点：Outer space exploration, for example, have consumed a large government expenditure.（中心句）  
To be more precise, rich counries （WHO） put considerable investments on developmenting technology and manufacturing equipment for astronomy (HOW) to search possible resources (WHY) in the space only catering for domestic demands of their countries.
- 从因果关系进行进一步解释  
原因一边表示前提，而结果一边会说明好处或者坏处。  
例如：  
In primery education, the law education should be compulsory. （中心句） As the primery students are the group who are innocent and do not have the ability to 
distingush right from wrong, they are supposed to learn the knowledge of law to rose their awareness of self-defence.  
The govenment should raise the public awareness of environmental preservation, thereby promoting sustainable development and creating a more livable environment.  
表示原因和结果的连接词：  

|原因| 结果 |
|:-:|:-:|
| because <br> as <br> for <br> since <br> ascribed/assoicated with <br> due to/owing to | as a consequence/result <br> therefore <br> thus <br> hence <br> thereby doing|


#### 举例论证
举出例子解释中心句。需要注意，例子应该具有代表性，尽量不要选择人物的例子。  
常见的举例方法是以小见大：从大类中选择一个具有代表性的事物说明。  
语料：  
- for instance/example
- to illustrate
- take...for instance
- a case in point is that...
- more specifically
- especially
- the upsides/downsides/advantages/benefits/disadvantages of...
- a typical example can be found in...
- such as（前面的词是上义词，后面的例举是下义词）

例如：   
The Asian countries are getting westernized at a staggering rate.（中心句） <u>Take China for example</u>, when youngsters go to the movies, it is common for them to choose Hollywood blockbusters over domestic films.  
To begin with, it is really helpful for university students to be taught some job-related skills that have already become a major focus of higher education.（中心句） <u>A typical example can be found in</u> the effort to develop their interpersonal skills now required by a growing number of companies as one of the most essential qualities of any job candidate.  


{% note info %}  
如上面的例句，写作时可以尽量使用动词非谓语形式作为后置定语对名词进行修饰，以扩展句子。  
扩展句子的三种方式：  
- 特定句式：例如强调句
- 后置定语从句： 例如 which 引导的状语从句  
- 动词非谓语形式作为后置定语  

{% endnote %}


#### 对比论证
通过对比反衬事物的优点，而对照突出差别。  
对比论证时需要注意避免词汇重复。  
语料：  
- likewise
- on the other hand
- conversly
- in constrast/by constrast：两个对象，前后形成相反的情形
- on the contrary：一个对象，否定前者陈述，并且提出更进一步的特性
- while
- wherearas
- similarly

{% note warning %}  
特别注意in constrast/by constrast和on the contrary的区别。
- in constrast/by constrast：两个对象，前后形成相反的情形
- on the contrary：一个对象，否定前者陈述，并且提出更进一步的特性

e.g.: Watching Television cannot improve children's study efficiency. on the contrary, the advertisements and programms could enable kids to be distracted/make distractions.  

{% endnote %}


##### 避免重复的方法
- 利用上下义解释进行替换  
例如：  
Generally speaking, buying over a dozen household equipment intended for daily use may be beneficial at home from cooking to entertainment. Microwave oven, for instance, allows housewives to cook rapidly <u>with the turn of a dial（convenient 的下义）</u>, and this convenience provides more options in daily life than in the past. Likewise, rice cooker can <u> simplifty the cooking process</u> by <u>reducing the number of steps</u> between people and their meal at having appliances, the more other work they are capable of doing, including just watching television in the comfort of home after a heavy day from work.  
- 利用同义词、近义词替换  
【find it difficult, struggle at, achieve the comparable levels】  
例如：  
题干： Governments should accept equal number of males and females in each major. To what extent do you agree or disagree?  
a. The acceptance of university is supposed to focus on students' accdemic performance, or scores, which is considered as the layout of personal abilities instead of gender differences (中心句). For instance, males may struggle at studying the majors such as education or administration rather than engineering. Similarly, it is not suprised that female students may find it is hard to achieve the comparable levels of comprehension and analysis when attending courses like calculus or signals and systems due to the gaps of patterns of thinking. Thus the perspective of persuiting the same acdemic achievements omitting the gender differences is biased and nature differences brought by gender should be respected properly.   
b. The acceptance/admission/enrollment of males and females in each major should depend on their overall abilities and academic performance, *instead of unrealistic gender quota*. *In most cases*, it is rare to see male students choose liberal art or education since they are often in lack of verbal skills or patience to become qualified teachers. *Similarly*, females are usually not good at engineering or physics due to their inborn/inherent features, *thus* having difficulty in reaching a comparable level as males. Therefore, it is reasonable for universities to respect their separate academic pursuit according to their natural talent.  
- 替换词性  
- 使用肯定词替换否定词  
e.g. gap year ↔ entrance university immediately  

### 假设论证
语料：  
- if
- suppose/assume
- providing that/on condition that
- when/once

需要注意使用虚拟语气时，注意时态降级（be->was/were, will->would）  

例文：  
Then, since the transportation system is the lifeline of a country's economic activities, its paralysis would lead to the disintegration of the economy, either industry, farming or day life. Supposing that all the means of transportation were halted for lack of oil, factories with insufficient raw materials would have to close, workers would be out of work, and ripe farm crops would have to stay in the fields at the mercy of rain and storms. People would try to store food and the price of all commodities would go up.

#### 让步
姑且承认相反观点的合理性，再加以反驳。  
如果让步和反驳写在一段，那么让步和反驳的分论点需要相同。  
如果让步单独成段，需要有明显的连接词以展示文章观点。  
语料：  
- although/though/in spite of the fact that...  
- as is granted/admittedly...
- opponents would argue that...  

例文：  
<u>As is granted</u>, saving money offers people a sense of security in case of emergency. <u>However</u>, people tend to believe that wise investment can get more benefits.  


{% note warning %}  
特别地，在雅思写作考试中不建议使用引用论证。  
{% endnote %}


## 结尾段
结尾段需要陈述所有的分论点，并总结全文。如果篇幅不够，还需要延伸拓展。  
- 不要重复前面的文字  
- 不要出现新观点  

### 结尾段替换
- 使用倾向性动词表示观点  
正面：  
prove/encourage/support/enable/assist/help/drive  
负面：  
lead to/prevent/hinder/threaten/pose a threat to  

例文：  
In conclusion, my view is that taking a year off allows young people to have <u>a broader view of life（分论点1）</u> and <u>better perosonal resources to draw on（分论点2）</u>.  

### 展望
进一步说明受益对象的好处，或者受害者的坏处。  
例文：  
Students with these practical experiences are usually the most effective and motivated ones.  



## 写作要点
### 正式用语
题目：  
Some people have argued that we should not make heroic efforts to preserve the natural habitats of endangered plants and animals when doing so would conflict with human interests. To what extent do you agree or disagree?  
例文：  
If *you look at it that way*,  true that humans and animals have conflicting interests. People have always exploited animals for food and clothing, and farmers have brought *bigger and bigger* areas of land under cultivation. *But should we keep on doing this?*  
In regions of the world where the population is growing and there *aren't enough* resources, the conflict between humans and animals is really *bad*. If you go to Africa, for example, *you can see large* natural reserves alongside, really poor human settlements.*I love the idea of elephants and lions live in the wild*, but often *it's* the poor farmer living nearby who's got to pay the cost in terms of land and
lost earnings.  

学术写作中需要注意的几个写作要点：  
- 不要使用not/is/are的缩写形式
- 回避第一、第二、第三人称
  - 使用被动语态
  - 使用 the public\teenagers等等具体的名词指代
- 规避口语化用词：比如really/biger and biger/love等等
  - really → extremely/seriously等等具体的副词
- 避免问句和感叹句、不恰当的标点
  - 问句可以改为"whether"作为主语的句子
- 避免使用习语

### 规避用语
1. with the development of→because of/做主语
2. In today's society/in contemporary society/nowadays...→直接写现象、信息
3. it is a issue people heatedly debate that.../highly controversial issue that ....
4. broaden one's horizon(建议：a broader view of life/become open-minded)
5. as is known to us all, ...(建议：in most cases)
6. Every coin has two sides./As the saying goes...
7. last but not (the) least(建议：besides/additionally)
8. in a nutshell(建议：in conclusion、To conclusion)
9. nowadays 前置并且后面没有今昔对比

## 范文学习方法
关注范文的三个点：  
- 行文结构和论证方法
- 用词：连接词和生僻表达 
 
然后模仿范文进行仿写。  

例文：  
However, reaching the conclusion that other functions such as giving access to knowledge for its own sake, are no longer important is biased.(中心句) For hundreds of years, <u> especially in the west </u> , the undergraduate education is, indeed a liberal education, which means the undergraduates learn a wide range of curriculums <u>such as</u> psychology, economics, politics that have no direct relations to jobs. <u>The upsides of this are that </u> it firstly enables students to become open-minded and help them lay a solid theoritical foundation, then they will be able to choose the most appropriate field based on their own interests for further studies.  

文章结构：  
- the conculusion that knowledge for its own sake is not important is biased:
  - examples
    - especially in west
    - liberal education
    - curriculum: psychology/ecnomies/politics
  - benefitis:
    - open-minded
    - lay the fundamentals
    - choose the territories
