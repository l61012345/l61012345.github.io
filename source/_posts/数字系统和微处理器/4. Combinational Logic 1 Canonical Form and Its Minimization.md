# Combinational Logic 1: Canonical Form and Its Minimization

## Logical Reasoning
Suppose the statement $F$ is determined by two variables：  
$A$, $B$, the relationship of $F$ can be expressed using the logical relationship between those two varibles, for example: $F=A.B$, then the statement is determined by the truth of $A$,$B$, which forms the following statement:  
If $A$ is True/False, $B$ is True/False, Then $F$ is True/ False.  

That is Logical Reasoning.   

## Binary in circuits
Input and output can only have two states.  
Methods of representing binary data：  
- True/False 
- 1/0   
- High/Low  
- Black/White  
- Level of voltage 

### Two ways to express binary in circuits 
#### Positive Logic Coding（正逻辑）
- 1 is assigned to the positive or higher voltage.  
- 0 is assigned to the negative or lower voltage.  

The calculation is **AND**： $F=A.B$  

#### Negative Logic Coding(负逻辑)
- 0 is assigned to the positive or higher voltage.  
- 1 is assigned to the negative or lower voltage.  

The calculation is **OR**：$F=A+B$.  


## Boolean Algebra's Canonical form（布尔代数的规范化形式）
### The minterm and the maxterm（最小项和最大项）
For a Boolean function of n variables:  
- Minterm is a product(and) term in which each of the n variables appears once.  
- Maxterm is a sum term in which each of the n variables appears once.  
Minterm and maxterm are dual/inverse.  

A complex system with more than one output can be considered as number of subsystems with single output and sharing common inputs.  

#### Example:  Combinational logic system 3 to 5 range indicator  
3 to 5 range indicator: a system inputs 3-bit binary numbers and the output is true (1) if inputs are in the range 3 to 5. 
The inputs has 8 cases.   
From  0 to 7 , we gets the truth table.

### The 1st canonical form（第一范式）
In the 1st canonical form:  
- Inputs are ANDed first.  
- Then ORed together to get the output.  

The result is minterm(最小项).  

Example: In 3 to 5 indicators, if $F$ is 1:  
The inputs of ABC are:  
$$(0AND1AND1) OR (1AND0AND0) OR (1AND0AND1)$$  
The description is:  
$$F=\overline{A}BC(011)+A\overline{B}\overline{C}(100)+A\overline{B}C(101)$$

This description can be drawn as a circuit:

#### Shorthand notation  
To avoid having to write down too long Boolean equations, the T/F can be replaced by 1/0.  
Example:  
$$F=A'BC+AB'C'+AB'C=011+100+101$$  
In decimal form, $F=3+4+5=∑(3,4,5)$.  

Example:  
Transcription of $F(ABCD)=∑(3,4,9,10)$, as 3 is 0011 4 is 0100 9 is 1001 10 is 1010.  
Hence, $F=\overline{A}\overline{B}CD+\overline{A}B\overline{C}\overline{D}+A\overline{B}\overline{C}D+A\overline{B}C\overline{D}$.
