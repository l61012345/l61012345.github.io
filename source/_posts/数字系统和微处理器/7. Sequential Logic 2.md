# Sequential Logic 2: Circuit Design
Parameter of a sequential circuit:  
- $I$ input data  
- $Z$ output data
- $Q$ internal data sets(also called states)

**The design of sequential logic is to modify the output end or the input end of the flip-flops to make flip-flops produce a desired system behaviour.**  

## Next State and Feedback Logic with Output logic
In this design concept, the flip-flops is to produce the changes from current state to another state, which is called next state feedback logic (次态反馈逻辑).  
The modicifactions will be implemented onto the output end of next state logic to produce a desired system output.  
  
### Next State feedback Logic
Next state(次态) logic: The sequenctial logic circuit operating the external inputs and internal state, feedback to form internal inputs.
In next state and feedback logic, the logic outputs representing internal state are feedback to provide internal inputs.  
  
**Only contribution of next state logic is to produce a motivation of state changing.**  

The designer of the next state logic has to be able to identify the internal states of the system and then design hardware to generate them.  

### Output Logic
The combinational logic circuit part to generate output $Z$.  
Inputs of the output logic are external input $I$ and the state $Q$.  
  
**Automatic logic** is a kind of logic which only has internal inputs and outputs.  

#### Implementation
Implement such a kind of logic requires:  

- Combinational logic with feedback
- Standard flip-flops
- Memory

The implementation steps:  

- identify the standared flip flops.  
- drive k-map between desired ouput and the output of next-state feedback logic circuit.  
  
#### Example: A 3-bit counter count in Gray Code
For 3-bit counter, it can be regareded as a next-state feedback logic to produce the state changing.
The relationship between output of counter $Q$ and desired output $Z$ is:

Based on this truth table, the K-map is:

Thus, the circuit for a Gray Code counter using output logic is:
