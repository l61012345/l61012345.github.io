# Programmable Logic
A dedicated logic circuit will only perform the function it was designed to implement.  
A combinational circuit behaves according to its truth table, whereas a sequential circuit's characteristics are governed by its state table.   
In a programmable logic system, a standard hardware structure is electronically reconfigurable so that the different logic operations can be performed, without having to change the circuit physically.  

## Multiplexer
The multiplexer （多路复用器） is a multi-input, single-output circuit whose prime function is to convert parallel data to serial data.
