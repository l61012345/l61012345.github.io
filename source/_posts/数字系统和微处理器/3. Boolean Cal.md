# Logical System and Boolean Algebra

## Logical System
Logical System is a kind of system based on Boolean Algebra (布尔运算) which can be represented by a black box（黑箱）.  
It has a set of input lines.

**Logic Gate**(逻辑门) is a kind of circuit parts which can do the Boolean algebra according to the voltage level.  

Parameters  of a logical gate:  
- Input --I
- Output ---Z
- Time --T

A logical system can be expressed as:  
$$Z_t=f(It)$$
where $Z_t$ is the output and $I_t$ is the input at time $t$.

### Types of logical system  
#### Combinational Logical System
If $I$ and $Z$ always constant, which means the value of Z does not change by time, this kind of  logical system called **Combinational Logical System** (组合逻辑系统).  
Same input in different time, the output is the same.  
Example: Adder (加法器)  

#### Sequential Logical System
If $I_t$ and $Z_t$ vary depending on time, this kind of logical system called Sequential Logical System （时序逻辑系统）.   
It has memory.   
The value of $Z$ always **vary from time to time**.  
Same input in different time, the output is different. Because the value depends on current and previous result.  
Example: Accumulator（累加器）,whose $output=input+previous output$.

**Combinational Logical System can be converted into Sequential Logical System**.   

#### Storage Logical System  
Storage Logical System is another logical system designed to hold information. Its input are address information and data information.   
The address is corresponding to the data.  
It can be organized into a Combinational Logic Function.  
Example: Memory(内存)  

## Logical and Propositional Statements  
**True or False can be described as Binary format**.  
For example, True presents for 1 and False presents for 0.
Any condition which has 2 cases is able to be described by 1-0 logical statements.   
One case is represented by 1, the other is by 0.  
The leading result can also be described by logical states.  
Example:  
To be the winner of 100 meter race(W):  
Condition to be a winner: fist one(F) and not foul(O)  
Only if F is True and O is True, W is True.  
So the condition of winner can be described as W=F AND O or W=F.O.  

### Truth Table
Truth Table(真值表) is a classical form based on logical statements to describe the relationship between all the possible conditions(inputs) and results(outputs).  
In above example, the condition can also be described as a truth table.  

|F | O |W |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|T|T |T|
|T|F|F|
|F|T|F|
|F|F|F|

Which can be converted to:  

|F | O |W |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|1 |1|
|1|0|0|
|0|1|0|
|0|0|0|

**In digital system, the voltage can be used to present true(1) or false(0)**.
