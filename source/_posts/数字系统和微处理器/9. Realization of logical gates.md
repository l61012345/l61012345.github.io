# Logic Gate Characteristics  

## The Tristate Gate
Tristate gate, has three output states. 
- An additional control input. 
- The control input is at logical 1 the gate behaves as an ordinary logic gate. 
- A logical 0 on the control the gate is disabled and the output enters its third state, having a high impedance between the earth and power supply rails. 

In the third state：   
- The gate can only supply or sink a few microamps of current
- The gate can neither drive nor load any device connected to it
- The gate is effectively disconnected from the circuit

####  Bus(总线) 
It can provide the communication from all the registers, it can transfer not a signal bit data.  
The Driver of Bus can control where the data will be transferred(to the driver of register whose value of 1)
A pulse is applied to the clock of the register into which the data is to be written.

## Logic Families
Bipolar and Metal oxide semiconductor.  
Both rely on the switching of transistors between discrete states and are suited to integrated circuit manufacture.  

### Bipolar Transistor
The earliest electronic logic based on diodes, cannot present NOT operation.  
The voltages representing the logical constants 0 and 1m could overlap and the system fail.  
Transistor can act as a two-state switch, its amplifier with 180 degree phase change.  

#### Transistor Transistor Logic(TTL)
A multiple emitter input transistor that：  
- High speed TTL has faster switching but high expense of power consumption.  
- Low power TTL has lower switching and expense of power consumption.  
  
The supply rail must be 5V for TTL.  

### Unipolar Logic Families
Based on the field effect transistor which requires a metal electrode separated form a semiconductor channel by an oxide insulating layer.  
MOS logic devices do not require internal resistors on the chips which brings high density package.  
MOS has a huge time consumption.  

#### P-MOS
Semiconductor is p-doped, is suited to large scale integration and has a greater packing density capability than bipolar transistor.  

#### N-MOS
N-MOS loigc is suited to large scale integration and has a greater packing density capability than bipolar transistor logic.  
The circuit carriers in N-MOS are free electrons, which are more mobile than larger positive charges, and this results in faster switching times compared with P-MOS.  

#### CMOS
Complementary metal oxide semiconductor, is faster than P-MOS, N-MOS, and is less power consumption than Low power TTL, and have a good operating time.  
In alongside TTL CMOS adopts to 5V, work alone-- 3V to 20V.  

### CMOS Circuit Logic
#### Fan-out
Number of logic inputs that can be driven from the output of a logic.  
A typical fan-out for a TTL is 10.  
With CMOS, it will drive more than 10 gates and potentially infinite.  
Fan-out should be limited to 50, due to the capacitive loading of inputs.  

#### Fan-in
The number of logic outputs that can be connected to a logic gate input.  
In TTL outputs, the internal transistors will be overloaded if the outputs are connected together.  

#### Rise Time and Fall Time
The time which taken for the lowest value to highest value, is measured from 10% to 90%.  
Fall time is inversed and measured fully.  

#### CMOS and TTL
A system may contain both CMOS and TTL.  
A high output from a CMOS can drive a TTL input but if CMOS
TTL's low output can drive CMOS because the low input of CMOS is (0-1.5V).  
The high output for TTL is about 3.6V, just for the high input for CMOS is (3.5-5.0V).
