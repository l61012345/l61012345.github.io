# Combinational Logic 2: Implementation using Digital Circuit

## Logical transformation 
To deal with the lack/limit of circuit components, the transformation are introduced.  
In implementation of circuits, an implementation of 2-input NAND/NOR gate requires 2 transistors （晶体管）, however, a 2-input AND/OR gate requires 4 transistors. To save the cost, NAND logic and NOR logic are introduced to transform the 1st/2nd canonical form into a NAND/NOR only used circuit.  

### NAND logic and 1st canonical form
#### AND to NAND
$$F=A.B=\overline{\overline{A.B}}$$

#### OR to NAND
$$\overline{A.B}=\overline{A}+\overline{B}$$
$$A+B=\overline{\overline{A}+\overline{B}}$$
The AND and OR gates can be replaced with their NAND equivalents for the 1st canonical form giving.  

### NOR logic and 2st canonical form
The NOR can be obtained from the minimal 2nd canonical by replacing AND and OR gate.
#### AND to NOR
$$A.B=\overline{\overline{A}+\overline{B}}$$

#### OR to NOR
$$A+B=\overline{\overline{A}.\overline{B}}=\overline{\overline{A+B}}$$

## Don't care condition（无效项）
The binary input combinations may never occur although they exist.
For example: in BCD(0-9) coding 1010(10) to 1111(15) are never used.  

Example: Seven Segment Display  
To represent numbers, corresponding segments will be lighten.

Example: 
- 0->a b e g c f     
- 2->a c d e g    
- 7->a c f   

To control segment a, we will design a system.
When number=0,2,3,5,7,8,9 $F_a=1$.  
In binary we need 4 bits to present the numbers 0-9, but 10-15 will be never used.  
All possibilities are listed using Kmap.  

{% note info %}  
The circuit adding don't care condition is not equal to the origin one, but the difference is omitted, so they are still equivalent.

## Harzard and Risk（竞争冒险）
Practical electronic logic circuits are not ideal devices.
They require a finite time to operate and consequently introduce delays into the
propagation of information.
- no more than a few $10^{-6}$s.  
- for very high speed logic, may be of the order of $10^{-9}$s  
- they may invalidate the laws of Boolean algebra and cause errors or hazard the logic state.  

The generation of harzards are caused by when a "1" and a "0" inputted into a logical gate within a short time. (i.e., like $F=A\overline{A}$ or $F=A+\overline{A}$)  

### Elimination of Hazards
#### Solution 1 : Wait and consider the valid output 
If the maximum number of gates in any propagation path is $𝑛$ and the delay of each gate is $𝑑𝑡$, the output of a combinational logic circuit will always be valid at time $T$, thus:  
$$ 𝑇 > 𝑛 × 𝑑𝑡$$ 

### Solution 2: Delaying gate arrangements
To replace the gates with long logical equivalent gates combinations.  
- have no effect on the value of the data.
- will present a delay.

### Solution 3: K-maps
- A hazard will always occur when switching between adjacent cells on a K-map that are unlooped.
- The hazard can be removed by looping the adjacent cells even if it involves introducing an otherwise redundant term into the function.
- A K-map can be used to detect and eliminate all hazards arising from the switching of any one variable.

## Cellular Logic
In cellular logic circuit, the logic functions can be transformed into cells with external I/O and internal I/O.  
- $I$ input of a cell   
- $Z$ output of a cell  
- $Q$ internal outputs of a cell and connects other cells.  

Example: 2bits adder
$$S_2S_1S_0=A_1A_0+B_1B_0$$
By listing the truth table and draw Kmaps, the presentations are:  
$$S_2=A_1B_1+A_0B_1B_0$$
$$S_1=A_1\overline{B_1}\overline{B_0}+A_1\overline{A_0}B_1+\overline{A_1}\overline{A_0}B_1+\overline{A_1}B_1B_0+\overline{A_1}A_0\overline{B_1}B_0+A_1A_0B_1B_0$$
$$S_0=A_0\overline{B_0}+\overline{A_0}B_0$$

For a two-bit adder, the internal relationship are very complex, in this case, the whole circuit can be regarded as a **black box** when a two-bit adder is used. **Only inputs and outputs are users cares about**.

But above logical presentations are not so universal when confronting with inputs with more bits. In this way, a one-bit adder can be regarded as a universal cell as:  
For an adder cell:  
- $A$ $B$ are the external inputs. 
- $S$ are the external outputs.
- $C$ for carry-in and carry-out is the increment I/O.

By adding more the same cells, the adder can support input with more bits:

Therefore, a logic relationship in this single cellular is:  
$$C_i=A_iB_i+A_iC_{i-1}+B_iC_{i-1}$$
$$S_i=\overline{A_i}\overline{B_i}C_{i-1}+A_i\overline{B_i}\overline{C_{i-1}}+\overline{A_i}B_i\overline{C_{i-1}}$$
