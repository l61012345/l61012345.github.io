# Combinational Logic 2: Implementation using Digital Circuit

## Logical transformation 
To deal with the lack/limit of circuit components, the transformation are introduced.  
In implementation of circuits, an implementation of 2-input NAND/NOR gate requires 2 transistors （晶体管）, however, a 2-input AND/OR gate requires 4 transistors. To save the cost, NAND logic and NOR logic are introduced to transform the 1st/2nd canonical form into a NAND/NOR only used circuit.  

### NAND logic and 1st canonical form
#### AND to NAND
$$F=A.B=\overline{\overline{A.B}}$$
    
#### OR to NAND
$$\overline{A.B}=\overline{A}+\overline{B}$$
$$A+B=\overline{\overline{A}+\overline{B}}$$
The AND and OR gates can be replaced with their NAND equivalents for the 1st canonical form giving.  

### NOR logic and 2st canonical form
The NOR can be obtained from the minimal 2nd canonical by replacing AND and OR gate.
#### AND to NOR
$$A.B=\overline{\overline{A}+\overline{B}}$$

#### OR to NOR
$$A+B=\overline{\overline{A}.\overline{B}}=\overline{\overline{A+B}}$$
