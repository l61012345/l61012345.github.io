# Sequential Logic 1: Types of Flip-Flops
## 	Sequential logic circuit
A sequential logic system with feedback connections from the output called internal inputs.  
User cannot control the internal inputs.  
For example:  

$$Q=\overline{R+\overline{S+Q'}}$$

- $Q'$ is the feedback (previous output).
- $Q$ is the current output, in the following calculation, this $Q$ will be back to $Q'$.  
- $S$ and $R$ the external inputs.  

If the inputs combination can cause the never-changed output($Q=Q'$), the output/combination/circuit is stable.  
In Kmap the stable combination is first numbered and then uncircled and the unstable combination will be marked with the number corresponding to its final stable combination but uncircled.

But for some combinations when $Q≠Q'$, they can never achieve the stable state.   

##  Two Fundamental Types of Flip-Flops (触发器)
### SRFF (Set-Reset Flip-Flop)（RS触发器）

Set and reset functions are introduced to this kind of system.  
The transition table defines the data transition from present state to next state($Q_t\rightarrow Q_{t+dt}$).  
SRFF can reduce the bounce in circuit.   

In SRFF, the truth table considering with feedback $Q'$ in previous time as input is:

(Note that only when $Q=Q'$, the system will become stable.)  

By such a table, a more condenced table can be concluded:

#### Rules
By exploring on above tables, the rules of SRFF can be found:  
- **If Set is on(the value is 1),the result(Q) will be turned to 1**.
- **If Reset is on(the value is 1), the result(Q) will be turned to 0.**  
- $SR=11$ (when previos input is 00) can cause hazard, the practical result will not same with the truth table.  

#### Limitations
The current change from one state to another (set-reset flip-flop, SRFF) practically is not simultaneous which can cause hazard.  
Example:  
$11→00$, $11→10/01(hazard)→101/010$.  

#### Variants of SRFF
The NAND/NOR only version SRFF(Also called SR Latch) is shown as below:
