# Type of Code
## Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD)
A digit is replaced by four bits:  
$$D=b_3b_2b_1b_0$$  
One of $b$ is called one bit and each bit's value has two condition: 1 or 0.

### Conversion
- Dec to BCD  
    Put each position to be Bin and put together.  
    Examples:  
    $D=87$,$d_1=8=1000_2$,$d_0=7=0111_2→10000111_{BCD}$  
    $D=34$,$d_1=3=0011_2$,$d_0=4=0100_2→00110100_{BCD}$  
    $D=198$,$d_2=1=0001_2$,$d_1=9=1001_2$,$d_0=1000_2$$→000110011000_{BCD}$  

- BCD to Dec  
    Divide by very 4 bits to a integer of Dec and put together.  
    Example:  
    $01010111_{BCD}$,$0101→5$,$1101→7$$→57_{10}$.  

### Weighted BCD(有权BCD码)
The weight（权) of each bits is different.(数位上的权发生改变，十进制数对应改变).  

Example: When $b_3b_2b_1b_0  = 1010$ ：

| Weight of 4 bits ||Dec |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|8 4  2   1 |1x8+0x4+1x2+0x1 | 10 |
|2 4  2   1 | 1x2+0x4+1x2+0x1 | 4 |
|7 4 -2 -1  |1x7+0x4+1x-2+0x-1 | 5 |

Common weight combinations of 4 bits are: 8421 2421 5421.  

- MSB/LSB  
    Most/Least significant bit (最高/最低有效位) the damage when change wrong MSB is the largest MSB is the first 1 bits and LSB is the last 1 bits.    
    The common BCD is presented for 8421code and 8421code can be seen as a special condition of weighted BCD.
    8421 code is the most classical one and it is also called **Pure Binary Position Coding**（自然二进制编码）.  

#### Conversion
Example: 
$759_{10}$:  
- 8421 code  
$7=0\times8+1\times4+1\times2+1\times1$, $5=0\times8+1\times4+0\times2+1\times1$, $9=1\times8+0\times4+0\times2+1\times1$   
$759_{10}=0111 0101 1001_{8421}$  

- 7421 code   
$7=1\times7+0\times4+0\times2+0\times1$,$5=0\times7+1\times4+0\times2+1\times1$,$9=1\times7+0\times4+1\times2+0\times1$.  
$759_{10}=1000 0101 1010_{7421}$  

## Gray Code
### Issue of Pure Binary Position Encoding
In Pure Binary Position Coding:  
Black blocks stands for value is 1.  
White block stands for value is 0.

From position 1 changes to 2 , $b_0$,$b_1$ had changed.  
But we can't decide the order of change position if the change is not simultaneous.  
So during the change there could be other positions produced, which may cause danger and error.  

### Gray Code:  Encoding Method
To prevent this potential danger, the Gray Code was invented.
Gray Code has no weight.   

### Quick Convertion
If $b_{n+1}$ is not existed, you can create it and let it be 0.  
$$g_n=b_n⊕b_{n+1}$$

{% note info %}  
⊕/XOR/exclusive or(异或)：  
a⊕b：  
- if a=b, the result is 0.  
- if a≠b, the result is 1.  
{% endnote %}

Now, from one position to another position, each change changes  only 1 bit, which prevent from error and danger.
